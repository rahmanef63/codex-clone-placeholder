### `nine-router` on both paths, deliberately duplicated

The slug exists twice, and that is not an oversight:

| path            | file                          | providers |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | --------- |
| `cloud` engine  | `src/convex/providers.ts`     | 11        |
| SvelteKit route | `src/lib/server/ai/config.ts` | 4         |

`src/convex/` cannot import from `src/lib/` — the Convex runtime bundles its own module
graph, so a shared constant is not an option without a build step. Both files pin the same
host (`https://router.antinrml.com/v1`) and both are host-pinned, so a mismatch would be
visible as a key sent to the wrong origin. Change one, change the other, and run
`vitest run src/convex src/lib/server/ai`.

## Gates, measured on this commit

```
vitest run          27 files / 138 tests passed
prettier --check    clean
eslint .            clean
svelte-check        0 errors, 0 warnings
```

Playwright is **not** green and cannot be claimed: see the correction below.

## Local activity log

`src/lib/server/log.ts` (one module, no dependency) writes NDJSON activity records for local
debugging. It is **off by default**: `LOG_LEVEL` must be set to `debug`, `info`, `warn` or
`error`, so a production deployment that sets nothing writes no file and no bytes.
`LOG_FILE` picks the path; the default `./.local-logs/activity.jsonl` is git-ignored and
created lazily on the first record.

Captured, one call per surface: `ai.config` (provider and model counts, MCP flag/server
count), `ai.chat.start` (provider, model, message count, total characters),
`ai.chat.end` (`ok`/`error`), `mcp.tools` (action, alias, tool name, outcome) and
`mcp.server` (JSON-RPC method, status, outcome).

Deliberately never captured: request or response bodies, message text, `authorization` or
`cookie` headers, API keys and tokens, and URLs with a query string. `logEvent` accepts flat
primitives only — an object or array is dropped rather than serialized — `redact()` strips
`sk-`, `Bearer ` and `x-api-key` shapes plus URL query strings, records are capped at 4 KiB,
and a write failure is swallowed. It is a developer aid, not an audit trail or a second
source of truth: nothing in the app reads the file.

## Correction — the AC test suites do not exist

`docs/PRD.md` §7 and `docs/implementation-plan.md` §10 both state that
`tests/workspace.e2e.ts` and `tests/acceptance.e2e.ts` cover AC01–AC18. They do not exist
in this tree, and nothing in `src/` or `slices/` references an AC id:

```
find . -name '*e2e.ts' -not -path './node_modules/*'
  ./tests/dev-smoke.e2e.ts          # 4 tests, hydration + navigation only
grep -rn 'AC[0-9][0-9]' src slices   # no matches
```

They were deleted deliberately by `6ed1f3e` ("rebuild on the Laya NPU workspace template"),
which removed the `/workspace`, `/capabilities`, `/settings` route family and their
acceptance suites. The PRD and the implementation plan were not updated in that commit.

So: **zero of AC01–AC18 have a browser test right now.** The 138 unit tests cover schema,
guards, transport, auth and config — not the acceptance scenarios. Both documents are stale
and are corrected here rather than quietly satisfied.

What `tests/dev-smoke.e2e.ts` actually proves, over three viewports: a clean clone boots
without credentials and hydrates, a local send appends a timeline entry with a stub reply,
a settings destination opens the settings window, and rail navigation reaches a lazily
loaded screen.

## Not started

Ordered by the reasoning in `docs/chatgpt-desktop-parity-windows.md` §7, cheapest first.

| #   | Item                                        | Blocker                                                              | Status      |
| --- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 1   | Projects                                    | none; `move-project`/`remove-project` already carry `disabledReason` | not started |
| 2   | Git surface: status, diff, stage, commit    | needs a server route + repo allowlist + process boundary             | not started |
| 3   | Plugin-extension entrypoints (MCP App host) | needs `@openai/mcp-extensions`; measured as the largest single gap   | not started |
| 4   | Memories                                    | needs a table and a retention decision                               | not started |

Out of scope unless a product decision changes it: parallel chat orchestration, Computer
Use, mobile remote relay, MCP 2.0 events.

## Restoring AC coverage

If AC01–AC18 are still the acceptance bar, the cheapest recovery is to read the deleted
suites out of history rather than rewrite them:

```
git log --all --oneline --diff-filter=D -- tests/workspace.e2e.ts tests/acceptance.e2e.ts
git show ad4a909:tests/acceptance.e2e.ts | head -40
```

They target the pre-`6ed1f3e` route family (`/workspace`, `/capabilities`, `/settings`), so
they will not run as-is: the shell now owns navigation and `/` mounts the workspace. Treat
them as the scenario list, not as runnable tests, and re-point each at the current
selectors before claiming the AC. Do not restore the files and call the gate green.

## How to update this file

Run the commands, paste the numbers, change the state word. Do not mark "shipped" from a
typecheck — the PRD says it plainly: a green typecheck is not browser proof.
